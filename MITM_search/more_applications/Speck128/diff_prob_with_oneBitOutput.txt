This file saves data related to prepended differential
\varDelta _in \xrightarrow {E_m} \varDelta _m.

example:
diff_out :  \varDelta _m
# [p1, p2, p3]  : pi is the optimal probability of
                          i-round prepended differential under
                          the fixed difference \varDelta _m
