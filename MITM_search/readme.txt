1、summary_of_B_S_and_gamma_m :
the summary of B_S (the set of strong unbalanced bits)
and gamma_m 
(non-duplicate mask returned in Stage 2 of Algorithm 2).

Remark:

1) Reviewer#B can obtain more details 
about the answer of Q2 based on this folder.


2、Speck64 ：
search DLAs of Speck64 using Algorithm 2.

Remarks:  

2)  We will introduce the details of MITM searching
by taking this project as example.

3) To make the project (i.e., Speck64) easier to understand, 
we have modified all the code from multiple aspects 
as follows:
    a)  all the notations / names are as consistent as possible with 
         the ones used in our paper.
    b)  important files and code are annotated.
    c)  some important results are collected and saved.


3、more_applications :
search DLAs of LEA and the remaining Speck members.

Remark:

4) Although the remaining projects 
    (LEA, Speck32, Speck48, Speck96, Speck128) 
    haven't been modified completely like what we do to Speck64, 
    based on the understanding of the project Speck64,
    we believe that it won't take too much time to understand.

    Moreover, important files and codes have been 
    included in these projects, 
    which will help readers obtain more details.
