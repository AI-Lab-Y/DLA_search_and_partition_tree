c1 :  the upper bound of absolute correlation weight 
        used to identify strong unbalanced bits  over E_m

c2 :  the upper bound of absolute correlation weight of
        linear trails of E_2

n_r  :  the number of encryption rounds covered by E_2

n_m :  the total number of non-duplicate 
linear mask $\gamma _m$
returned in Stage 2


for LEA,  when c1 = 8,  c2 = 10,  n_r = 5, 
we have n_m = 1670

for Speck32,  when c1 = 8,  c2 = 4,  n_r = 3,
we have n_m = 43

for Speck48,  when c1 = 8,  c2 = 4,  n_r = 3,
we have n_m = 56

for Speck64,  when c1 = 8,  c2 = 6,  n_r = 4,
we have n_m = 114

for Speck96,  when c1 = 8,  c2 = 8,  n_r = 5,
we have n_m = 779

for Speck128,  when c1 = 8,  c2 = 11,  n_r = 5,
we have n_m = 369

remark:
Some linear masks can be filtered in advance 
by considering the probability of the prepended differential together, 
thus, the actual number of linear masks that need 
to be tested in Stage 3 doesn't exceed n_m.

for example, for LEA,  at least a total of (454 + 948 = 1402) 
linear masks are filtered. The concrete reason is presented in 
'./LEA/how_to_filter_masks_in_advance.txt'.
